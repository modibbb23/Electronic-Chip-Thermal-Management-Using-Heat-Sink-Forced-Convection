# Electronic-Chip-Thermal-Management-Using-Heat-Sink-Forced-Convection
Modeled and meshed a chip (10mm × 10mm × 1mm) with heat sink using ANSYS SpaceClaim and generated a polyhedra mesh with 144406 nodes and skewness below 0.8. The forced convection cooling setup was implemented with 1m/s air flow and 20°C inlet temperature.
